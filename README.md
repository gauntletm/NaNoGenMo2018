# NaNoGenMo2018

Slightly incoherent code. I'm alternating between printf and echo because I ran into an issue with repeated lines in the outfile (which turned out to have been an instruction to sed that I forgot to remove) and in the end didn't bother to clean up due to a shortage of time.

I created my corpus from:
* "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" by Lewis Carroll (which seems to be used by many participants)
* "Fight Club" by Chuck Palahniuk
* "Illuminatus!" by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson
* "Neuromancer" by William Gibson
* "On the Road" by Jack Kerouac
* "Out of the Aeons" by H.P. Lovecraft
* "The Teachings of Don Juan" by Carlos Castaneda
* "Treasure Island" by Robert Louis Stevenson
